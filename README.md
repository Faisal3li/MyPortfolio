# My Portfolio
Your portfolio is a way to show the world who you really are. Expressing your hard work and dedicated achievements to show the world what you're capable of. So I thought of a unique way to show that, instead of the plain old paper passing, phone calling, and meet and greet. I expressed myself thorugh the Web. So here I present to you MyPortfolio.

## Thought Process
At first, I drew the structure of my models, also showing an adaptive association with each other. I assembled well order links to my models to provide the user with a trouble-free experience. Secondly, I thought of ways of how the website would work, assigning suiteable names to elements, and then how to connect each part to it's necessary other. Finally I would then practice ways to make my code neater and more understandable.

## Unsolved Problems
I would really love to finish my website with a few more quirks like: Add reviews, add comments and likes, private messaging, and the use of Heroku.
